  # Creation of new Users is handled by Sessions controller.  When a new session

  # The plan now is that page views that are handled through *this* User
  # controller (or one of its methods rather) should be pages that are private
  # and only visible to someone who is signed in.  Either these pages have no
  # meaning if no one is signed in (like, the page that lists the events you
  # have registered for, would have no meaning if no one is signed in), or they
  # are some other kind of page you should only see if you are signed in.
  # So we needn't check if you are an adminstrator... skip that check..
