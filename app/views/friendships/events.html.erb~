<h2>Program</h2>
<p>A Forging Friendships event is where traditional and special needs children come together in a safe and structured setting.</p>  

<p>Each event will have different tables with specific activities geared specifically towards special needs children. These tables are called “kindness centers” and will have a group of traditional children (volunteers trained in the Empathy in Action program) ready to assist the special-needs child as they explore each activity. </p>

<p>Parents of the special needs child would be required to stay at the event, exploring the kindness centers together; this is a collaborative experience. The traditional child is not responsible for the special needs child but befriends the special needs children with each learning activity.  All while gaining a deep, more compassionate understanding of children with physical and intellectual disabilities.. </p>

<p>Children with and without disabilities learn from each other through this experience and all the children involved will experience the joy in meeting new friends, even the parents! Everyone gains friendship.
